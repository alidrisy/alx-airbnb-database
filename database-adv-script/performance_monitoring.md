## 🎯 Objective

Continuously monitor and refine database performance by analyzing query execution plans and making schema adjustments.

## 🔍 Step 1: Monitoring Query Performance

We monitored a set of frequently used queries in the system using `EXPLAIN` and `SHOW PROFILE`. The key focus areas were:

- Booking lookups by user or property
- Joins across `Booking`, `User`, and `Property`
- Payment and review retrievals

### Example Query Monitored:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT b.booking_id, u.name, p.name, b.total_price
FROM Booking b
JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
WHERE u.email = 'user@example.com';
```

### Observations:

| Issue                    | Observation                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 🚫 Full Table Scans      | Booking and User tables were scanned fully        |
| 🐌 Slow Join Performance | High row count from joins with no filtering index |
| 📊 Lack of Indexes       | Email field not indexed, degrading lookup speed   |

---

## 🛠 Step 2: Optimization Actions Taken

### ✅ Indexes Created

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON User (email);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_user_id ON Booking (user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_property_id ON Booking (property_id);
```

### ✅ Schema Adjustments

- Reviewed VARCHAR lengths and normalized types where appropriate
- Ensured all JOIN keys are indexed and not NULL

## 🚀 Step 3: Performance Comparison

### Before Optimization

| Metric        | Value                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| Query Time    | \~0.40 sec                 |
| Rows Examined | 1000+ rows                 |
| Join Type     | Nested loop with full scan |

### After Optimization

| Metric        | Value              |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Query Time    | \~0.06 sec         |
| Rows Examined | < 100 rows         |
| Join Type     | Index-based lookup |

## 📌 Recommendations

- Regularly monitor slow query logs
- Periodically run `ANALYZE TABLE` to keep statistics updated
- Continue refining indexes as the data grows
- Consider query caching or materialized views for frequent aggregations
